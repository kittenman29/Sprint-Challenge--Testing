Week 14 Testing 

1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
Describe creates a block that groups together several related tests, whereas it actually encorporates the 
testing parameters.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
The point of test driven development is to create clean code that you know for sure works.
It eliminates the need to manually test your own work through using your app in the DOM.  It is a smart
way to go about building an app, but it's also time intensive to learn it.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
Unit test, input-output test, and integration test.
